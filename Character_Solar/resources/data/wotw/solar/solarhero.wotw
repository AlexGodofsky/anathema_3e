The clinch of the Lawgivers does not fail.
The Solar suffuses his body with the Essence of the Sun.
The fury of the Lawgivers scatters their enemies like leaves before the storm.
The ﬁsts of the Solar Exalted can stun even legends.
The Lawgivers’ arts of battle bring an unrelenting punishment to their enemies.
The Solar burns with Essence.
