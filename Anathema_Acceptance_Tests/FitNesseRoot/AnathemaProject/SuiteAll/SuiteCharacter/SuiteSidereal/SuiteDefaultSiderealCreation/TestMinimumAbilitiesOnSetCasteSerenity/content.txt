!3 Setting the Caste

Set the caste Serenity...

!|Set Concept|
|caste|
|Serenity|

... and check on the abilities:

!3 Caste ablilities

!|Check Abilities|
|Trait Type|isCaste?|
|Craft|true|
|Dodge|true|
|Linguistics|true|
|Performance|true|
|Socialize|true|

!3 New Minimum Ablilities

Check their initial state.

!|Check Abilities|
|Trait Type|value?|
|Craft|0|
|Performance|2|
|Linguistics|3|
|Medicine|2|
|Presence|2|
|Socialize|3|

Check that the new minimum abilities may not be lowered any more.

!|Set Abilities|
|Trait Type|value|
|Performance|1|
|Linguistics|2|
|Medicine|1|
|Presence|1|
|Socialize|2|

!|Check Abilities|
|Trait Type|value?|
|Performance|2|
|Linguistics|3|
|Medicine|2|
|Presence|2|
|Socialize|3|


!3 Alternative Requirements Craft and Performance

'''Craft''' and '''Performance''' are alternative requirements. So if Performance is set to 2 Craft may be lowered:

!|Set Abilities|
|Trait Type|value|
|Performance|2|
|Craft|0|

!|Check Abilities|
|Trait Type|value?|
|Performance|2|
|Craft|0|

But now Performance might no longer be lowered:

!|Set Abilities|
|Trait Type|value|
|Performance|1|

!|Check Abilities|
|Trait Type|value?|
|Performance|2|
