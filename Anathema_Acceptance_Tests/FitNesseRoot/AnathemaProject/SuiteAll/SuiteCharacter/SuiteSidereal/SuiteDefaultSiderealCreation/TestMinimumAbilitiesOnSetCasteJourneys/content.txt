!3 Setting the Caste

Set the caste Journeys...

!|Set Concept|
|caste|
|Journeys|

... and check on the abilities:

!3 Caste ablilities

!|Check Abilities|
|Trait Type|isCaste?|
|Endurance|true|
|Ride|true|
|Sail|true|
|Survival|true|
|Thrown|true|

!3 New Minimum Ablilities

Check their initial state.

!|Check Abilities|
|Trait Type|value?|
|Endurance|2|
|Ride|3|
|Survival|2|
|Linguistics|2|
|Athletics|2|

Check that the new minimum abilities may not be lowered any more.

!|Set Abilities|
|Trait Type|value|
|Endurance|1|
|Ride|2|
|Survival|1|
|Linguistics|1|
|Athletics|1|

!|Check Abilities|
|Trait Type|value?|
|Endurance|2|
|Ride|3|
|Sail|0|
|Survival|2|
|Linguistics|2|
|Athletics|2|

!3 Alternative Requirements Ride and Sail

'''Sail''' and '''Ride''' are alternative requirements. So if Sail is set to 3 Ride may be lowered:

!|Set Abilities|
|Trait Type|value|
|Sail|3|
|Ride|0|

!|Check Abilities|
|Trait Type|value?|
|Sail|3|
|Ride|0|

But now Sail might no longer be lowered:

!|Set Abilities|
|Trait Type|value|
|Sail|2|

!|Check Abilities|
|Trait Type|value?|
|Sail|3|
