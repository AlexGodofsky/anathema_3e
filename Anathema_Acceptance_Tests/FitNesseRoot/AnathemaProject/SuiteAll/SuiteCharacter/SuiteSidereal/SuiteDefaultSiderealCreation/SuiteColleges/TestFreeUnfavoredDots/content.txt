!3 Spend General Dot Allotment
There are no caste colleges. Setting any should spent the (3) free general dots.

!|SetSiderealColleges|
|traitType|value|
|Sword|3|

No Bonus Points should be spent.

!3 Assign Another Dot
Any further dots spent break the alloted limit.

So we need to expend Bonus Points (8 for a non-caste college).
