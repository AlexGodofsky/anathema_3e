Anathema Sourceforge Application (22/10/04)
===========================================

The project aims to develop an exhaustive suite of management toolkits for role-playing game of  
"Exalted", published by White Wolf Game Studio of Atlanta, Georgia.

The first waypoint is a character generation- and management-tool, providing assistance to players 
along the way, afterwards, more wide-scaped tools like (MP3-)playlist-management, notekeeping, 
storyline/chapter outlines will follow.

Although a similiar project (http://www.edexalted.com) is already widely advanced and implements many 
of the basic features we aim for, we consider the usability of said project to be lacking and are 
missing key features like a overarching campaign management utility to supplement basic character 
management.

The project will be implemented solely in Java, aiming for compatibility with language version 1.4 
until language version 5.0 is widely distributed. As a component of the character generation part 
relies on Scalable Vector Graphics, Apache Batik (xml.apache.org/batik) will be distributed with the 
package. Persistence and Data Management rely on XML, using either DOM4J (http://www.dom4j.org/) or 
JDOM(http://www.jdom.org) for access.  Supported OSs, obviously, will depend solely on the availability 
of the Java Virtual Machine.

[REMARK ON JAVA 5: With the advent of Eclipse 3.1 M3 we've decided to make the switch to Java 5.0
earlier than expected, as most of the enhanced features are already available within the IDE. 
(added 13/11/04)]

[REMARK ON XML: XML-handling now is DOM4J only, to scale down the size of file releases. There's not
much between JDOM and DOM4J in terms of features, so we decided to kick one of them. (added 13/11/04)]

Main focus along the road will lie on extensibility and support for future expansions to the published 
game line, with obstacles arising in modeling of game-related terms into language classes, while still 
allowing support for sometimes highly specific exceptions from the usual ruleset. Another point of 
interest is graphics and design, where we aim to provide several unique look and feels for users to 
chose from, themed with key points of the game world. Another problem to solve is grouping and attachment
of objects. 

Features
=======
o Character generation for all types of characters in the game line beginning with game-related
	 statistics and extending to several sets of annotations
o Character management for said character-types including character advancement and modification
o Character sheet printout in different varieties and levels of detail
o Campaign management with abilities to link objects, including but not limited to characters,
	playlists, annotations and images, to each other
o Playlist management featuring the possibility to assign music and sounds to virtually every object
	and send them to the default media player
o Unique look and feel for each character type
