This looks like it could wind up being indispensable, 
	and I can't wait to see where you guys go with it.

W00t!  It's coming together nicely.  Anathema /feels/ better than any of the other
Exalted generators I've used. Keep up the good work.
	-Argyle

Very nice. Crisper than the other two Exalted editors I've used before. 
I like that you didn't go overboard with colors either [...]. 
Can't wait for future versions!
	-mEGA

Nice.

I just installed the latest version, and it is sweet. [...]
The format is a lot cleaner and easier to use.  I just wanted to say thanks.

Anathema is just laid out so much better then [another product], 
that I am trying to use it despite not all the pieces are there yet.

From poking around the site, Anathema looks really nice, and a lot more user-friendly in 
layout than [that other tool].

It's looking pretty nice so far, and the campaign management stuff is coming along.
