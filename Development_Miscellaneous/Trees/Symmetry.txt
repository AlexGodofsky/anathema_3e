Straight Line Symmetry (for Martial Arts)
==========================================
IF
	all nodes on a given layer have the same outdegree and indegree
AND IF
	the tree consists of only on subtree
THEN
	all layers can be centered around a single point.
	
ALGORITHM
	Get Widest Layer (nodecount)
	Calculate width
	Half width is centerpoint
	Place nodes on centerpoint, with an offset depending on the number of nodes in their layer.
