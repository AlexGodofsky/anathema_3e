* The Shillouette or visualization thing, that when you chage your
stats it changes the drawing.
* When you select a background like Artifact or Manse, you can select
from a list of canon or user created ones.
* The No Solar Circle spells from start.
* The automatic Unlearning charms thing or a warning or something, so
that when you start playing with Essence or Ability traits, it
unlearns charms that do not meet the prerequisites.
* Info in the User Guide - Reference pages of all those rules, like
liege, Appearence and Essence for Abyssals, etc.
* The thing about only the abilities for which at least one charm is available
are shown, whith the "Don't check prerequisites", "fulfill all
prerequisites", "Don't check prerequisites", and "Enforce
prerequisites" that you mentioned.
* Anima effects in Concept and Rules, and that user can change the
description like in natures.
* Links in the Help menu.



Ok, thats a lot of things, and when i was writing them down, i have other ideas:
* With the Shillouette or visualization thing, being something quite
complicated, i think that for now it would be good to just show a
picture, so maybe in the description would be a browse button, so you
can browse your directories for a picture or a drawing, and it would
show up in the program, with that character.
* Put the User and maybe Instalation Guides in the zip file, so when
you download the program you have that guides along with the readme,
versions, and faq files.
*Remove Sorcery BG for Immaculates
*Change min Traits for Immaculate MArtist to MA3 / Ess 3 (for spirit walk / sight)

Maybe put that in the user guide, or
in another section call spells instead of under charms. And maybe put
the explination of Liege in the user guide, because i didn't remember
that liege only give you bonus points in certain backgrounds and in
Favored and Caste abilities and Charms (and took me some time to
figure that out).
