Nothing is so wet that an Immaculate of Hesiesh cannot set it alight.
The Fire Immaculate shifts and dances like a candle’s eager flame.
A tongue of flame travels from the Immaculate’s heart to her fist.
His hand sheathed in flame, the Immaculate covers a foe in burning Essence.
Fires cause great damage, and they are recognized and respected for their illimitable hunger across Creation.
