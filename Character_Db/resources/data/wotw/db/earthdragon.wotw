Like the Imperial Mountain and the Realm’s impervious War Manses, those who emulate Earth are eternal.
Dragons of Earth spend months training their bodies to ignore pain and resist harm.
The Earth Immaculate uses her Essence to ground herself in the earth.
Immaculates of Earth have an affinity for the inanimate.
Hidden stones shatter plows, and striking a mountain breaks the blade.
By interrupting a target’s normal Essence flows with immobile earth Essence, the Immaculate can freeze her foes in place.
Earth is the element of stability and physicality.
