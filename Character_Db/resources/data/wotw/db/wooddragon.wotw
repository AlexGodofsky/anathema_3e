The Wood Immaculate is master of the patterns that govern life and survival.
Followers of the Wood Dragon master the flow of life within their own bodies early in their training.
Immaculates see the Wood Dragon as more than the font of life in Creation.
Certain pressure points cause a subject to relax uncontrollably, momentarily losing all motivation to move or act.
The Wood Immaculate’s understanding of spirit Essence allows her to channel her own Essence through an attack into opposing spirits.
As a thin vine grows along a wall and inevitably destroys it,  the Immaculate is able to tighten his Essence around a spirit-foe and tear its core to shreds.
Her mastery over wood Essence allows the Immaculate to detect the patterns of death—death that has occurred, or death that impends.
