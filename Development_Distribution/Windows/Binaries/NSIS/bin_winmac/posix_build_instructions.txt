This should be put on the wiki eventually.

The files here are a combination of binaries pulled from the windows install of NSIS and the makensis executable compiled on OSX.

Build Instructions:
- Download the NSIS 2.46 source code: http://sourceforge.net/projects/nsis/files/NSIS%202/2.46/nsis-2.46-src.tar.bz2/download
- Requires scons to be installed by whatever means you choose.
- Compile makensis using this: scons SKIPSTUBS=all SKIPPLUGINS=all SKIPUTILS=all SKIPMISC=all NSIS_CONFIG_CONST_DATA_PATH=no PREFIX=. install-compiler

Once the makensis binary has been compiled, it needs to be added to Development_Distribution/Windows/Binaries/NSIS/bin_linux or bin_solaris.  Make a copy of the files in bin_winmac, remove the win and mac executables, and put them in the same folder as above.

I can't find an easy way to have a 4 platforms share the common files, though I think it should be possible using the NSIS_CONFIG_CONST_DATA_PATH, PREFIX, PREFIX_BIN, and all the other various prefix options.  I got tired of fooling around with it honestly, but I'll take another go at it if reducing this duplication is necessary.
