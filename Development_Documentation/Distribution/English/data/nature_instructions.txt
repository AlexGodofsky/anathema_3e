	            Customizing Natures
===------------------------------------------------------------------------------===
The program comes complete with all natures from the Exalted core rulebook, 
but copyright reasons force us to omit the willpower recovery conditions. 
You are highly encouraged to replace the stub descriptions we provide by more useful ones!

A nature in Anathema is represented by three parts: An unique ID for identification purposes,
the nature's name as it appears in the program and on character sheets and a
willpower recovery condition. For the core natures already included, ID and Name are both 
set to the nature's name as given in the core rulebook, while the condition only states 
the page to look for a complete description.

The first step in changing existing natures as well as creating new ones is to create a 
new file "natures.xml" in the subdirectory "data", then editing the content of this file.
The nature file must begin with a root element "<naturelist>" and then specify any number of
"nature" entries, before ending with a final "</naturelist>".
A "<nature>" element has a single attribute, announcing it's presence to the program: "id".
A very simple file could look like this:
//Example 1:
<naturelist>
	<nature id="CustomAnathemaNature" />
</naturelist>

This file is read during the Anathema launch process and it's contents are added to the
nature list. 
However, our newly created nature would show as "##Nature.CustomAnathemaNature.Name##" 
in the character concept screen, since the program only know an id, but no name.
We will have to tell the program what to put in its place, and attach a willpower recovery condition.

To do so, create a simple text file in the Anathema main directory, called "custom.properties".
Within, each nature requires two entries, consisting of a key and a value, adhering to the format
"key=value".
The first line adds a name to the id, here the key is, "Nature.[Insert Nature's ID].Name", while
the second key is "Nature.[Insert Nature's ID].Text".

NOTE: "Gain Willpower" is always included in front of the text, so you need to enter the conditional
phrase ("when...", "any time...") only.

For our example nature, these lines could read:
Nature.CustomAnathemaNature.Name=Custom Nature
Nature.CustomAnathemaNature.Text=when succesfully customizing a nature.

If you want to overwrite either name or condition of a pre-existing nature, just fill the "custom.properties"
file with the appropriate lines. The ids used are the titles of the natures as written in the rulebook.
