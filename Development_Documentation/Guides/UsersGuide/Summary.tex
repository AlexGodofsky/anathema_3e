\chapter{Introduction}
This guide, incomplete as yet, aims to explain the various intricacies of using Anathema.

It currently focuses on those features of Anathema dealing with the bookkeeping aspects of Exalted. All you need is basic familiarity with your computer and the Exalted rules. Copies of the books might come in handy at times, but should not be necessary for understanding.

To use the program, you will need the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) Version 5 or later. It is available free from the Java website\footnote{http://www.java.com}.

For details about installation, launch and configuration, please refer to the Anathema Installation Guide available at the project website.
