Two years in the making, version 1.0 of Anathema is finally upon us. Among other features, it brings a redesign of the foundations of the program. I took this as a chance of rewriting the year-old download system, as well as revising the present guide. 

I hope for this guide to answer all question that arise during download, installation and configuration of Anathema. All you require are a standard issue PC, internet access and basic computer skills.

I have tried to keep the guide independent of operating system specialties - and I failed spectacularly. If anything does not work as written or needs further clarification for a specific system, please let me know. This is especially true of Mac OS X, which I have never even touched. A plethora of contact options is provided at the Anathema website\footnote{http://anathema.sf.net}. You can also mail me directly\footnote{urskr@users.sf.net}.
